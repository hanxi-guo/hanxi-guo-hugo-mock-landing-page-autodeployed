# Issue Report: Image Rendering Behavior in Hugo

## **Problem Summary**
When running the `hugo server -D --disableFastRender` command:
- **Sub-repo (original Hugo Bootstrap theme)**: Images render correctly.
- **hugo-mock-landing-page repo**: Images do not render, leaving placeholders or broken image spaces.

This inconsistency raises questions about the cause of the rendering differences between the two repositories.

---

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the sub-repo and run:

```
cd /themes/hugo-bootstrap-theme/exampleSite
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

-  Images are rendered correctly on the locally served website.

1. Navigate to hugo-mock-landing-page and run:

```
cd hugo-mock-landing-page
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```
-  Images do not render correctly, leaving empty placeholders.

**My thought**
1. firstly I could make sure that I already download 
` @filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme` and `npm` and `node.js` by using 
```
npm -v
node -v
```

2. basically I follow the instruction in `readme.md` in original theme repository except for `themesdir = "node_modules/@filipecarneiro"` since our HW1 instruction need us to delete this line
3. I couldn't find where the figure that need to be render is, thus I have no idea how to solve this issue now

Thank you for taking the time to review this issue and for any feedback you can provide. Your help is greatly appreciated! ðŸ˜Š
